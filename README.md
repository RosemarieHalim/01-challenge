# Challenge 01: Introduction to HTML and CSS

## Overview

A marketing agency requires a codebase that follows accessability standards so their site is optimized for search engines.

* As a developer, I want to view and fix the code to fit the standards and make code navigatable for future coders.

## Changes

For the code I applied changes to:

*   divs with classes of header and footer into the proper HMTL elements
*   divs with classes for sections were converted to section elements
*   adjusting CSS styles to target the elements instead of divs with element class (ex. div class="header" )
*   added alt attributes to all images and icons
*   changed title element to company name and mention the homepage to inform users where they are located
*   created comments to separate important sections of the website to make navigating the code easier

## Takeaway

The goal of this project is to clean up the code without directly changing how the website looks. The main focus is to restructure the skeleton to create a better codebase that will be accessable to new coders for future changes.
